# Module 1: Set up

### Concepts

Docker is a platform for deveopers and sysadmins to develop, deploy and run applications with containers.

### Images and containers

A container is lauched by running an image. An image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application--the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.

A container is a runtime instance of an image

### Containers and virtual machines

A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers

A virtual machine runs an OS with virtual access to host resources through a hypervisor.

### Prepare environment

### Connect to Ubuntu VM

$ ssh workshop@workshop-vm-[x].eastasia.cloudapp.azure.com -i ./ssh-key/id_rsa
```

### Get Docker engine - Ubuntu

1. Update the apt package index

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
```

2. Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
```

3. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key

```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

4. Setup the stable repository

```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```

5. Install the latest version of Docker Engine

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

### Test Docker

```

2. List docker image that was downloaded

$ sudo docker image ls

REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

3. List all containers

```bash
$ sudo docker ps -a
