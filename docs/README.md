# Azure Cloud Workshop 

> Focus on Docker and AKS

This hands-on lab is designed to guide you through the process of learning, building and deploying Docker images to the Kubernetes platform hosted on Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS), in addition to learning how to work with dynamic service discovery, service scale-out, and high-availability.

At the very first of this lab, we will introduce you a bit about the sample application, walk you through some of basic architecture and structure of application. The we will do the step by step to build, containerize, and run it on AKS.

At the end of this training, you will have a better understanding of Docker, Kubernetes, and AKS and should be able to build and deploy containerized applications to Azure Kubernetes Service and perform common DevOps procedures.
